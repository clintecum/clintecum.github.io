  <h2>How can abstract random thinking be useful at DBC?</h2>
  <p>When I first took the thinking style quiz and graphed my results I thought to myself: great…my mind wants to go in the exact opposite direction of the concrete sequential style of thinking which for some reason I’d already declared in my mind to be the best-suited of the four thinking styles for producing computer code.  But even if coding does in some sense come down to producing sequentially ordered lines formed into syntactically-correct statements, that's still a pretty narrow-minded way of looking at computer programming - and nobody ever said these were all-or-nothing categories anyway.  So how can having a predominantly abstract random thinking style be used advantageously by a student at DBC?  </p>
<h4>Some abstractly laid out plans for handling Phase 0 struggles and generally<br> broadening the mind to develop a more growth-oriented mindset</h4>
  <p>

Ultimately I think an abstract random learning/thinking style becomes something that's useful to a DBC student for the reasons listed in Anthony Gregorc’s theory of mind styles, which emphasizes that AR learners enjoy personalized group-oriented environments that are more governed broadly by general principles than they are by rigidly structured routines.  Maybe this kind of orientation is especially useful on the cultural side of the curriculum because listening to others and communicating effectively in group situations (like pair programming) are things that tend to come fairly naturally to abstract random learners...I'm not really sure yet.   </p>

<p>Phase O has gone pretty smoothly overall, but I have been struggling with things like timeboxing and wrapping things up as quickly as I should.  I'm finding it's hard for me to approach a week's challenges one by one in successive order.  I usually want to start the next challenge before I've even finished the last one, even though I know I'd probably be better off taking the time to reflect on a challenge as soon as I've finished working on it.  I think this definitely reflects my abstract random learning style.  The problem with doing things randomly is that it sometimes leaves you with a scattered sense of how the picture was supposed to fit together.  Given my learning style, I think the best plan of action for dealing with these problems would involve working more closely with others each week.  I'm finally beginning to realize that peer pairing really and truly is a better way to get through these challenges.  Not only is it easier to timebox, but it's also in itself beneficial to communicate about your own thought processes happening inside your mind as you're in the process of working on a coding challenge.  Peer pairing forces you to be more conscious of what you're doing while you're doing it, which is essential to learning. </p>




<p>I don’t really know what the best answer is for what to do in order to broaden and expand how your mind learns and thinks.  At a certain point I think broadening and expanding your mind comes down to stepping outside your old habits and forcing yourself to do what probably feels unnatural.  That doesn’t necessarily mean a big change has to happen all at once in one dramatic moment of climax.  Ultimately it’s probably more just a matter of trying out new learning or thinking strategies in tolerable dosages with enough regularity to allow truly broadening scales of changes to unfold gradually.</p>
<p>
First of all you have to be open to the very idea of broadening your horizons enough that you can even appreciate what other styles of thinking and learning might have to offer to someone with your orientation and background.  Then maybe you can actually step back and watch how others approach solving a problem in order to decide if what works for them is something that's worth trying out for yourself.  But you might also ask yourself: are you actually fully aware of how you really learn and think, or are you just taking a quiz made by some guy at a school in Connecticut that tells you you’re primarily either a, b, c or d?  For me Dr. Gregorc’s quiz is really just a starting point for trying to understand how my mind "thinks" and "learns".  Maybe it’s just me, but questions like this don't exactly lend themselves to immediately obvious answers.  They require personal reflection over prolonged periods of time.  Sometimes learning is so subtle we don’t even really see it as it’s happening!
