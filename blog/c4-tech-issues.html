  <h1>Age Discrimination in IT</h1>

  <h2><span class="title-ital">A common perception inside the tech industry persists that "people over forty-five basically die in terms of new ideas."

  </span></h2>

    <p>Although the true extent to which hiring practices inside the tech industry are affected by age discrimination might not be something that's easily pinpointed or verified, few deny that it’s a genuine industry-wide problem for those with highly trained IT skill sets expecting long-term job security.  In a recent article posted on LinkedIn entitled “The Tech Industry’s Darkest Secret: It’s All About Age,” one commentator even goes as far as to say that:</p>

<p class="quote">“The harsh reality is that if you are middle-aged, write computer code for a living, and earn a six-figure salary, you’re headed for the unemployment lines. Your market value declines as you age and it becomes harder and harder to get a job.”<a class="ref" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130422020049-8451-the-tech-industry-s-darkest-secret-it-s-all-about-age">1</a></p>

<h2><span class="title-ital">Mark Zuckerberg: "Young people are just smarter."

  </span></h2>

<p>In fact, some people within the industry even seem to suggest that ageism is perfectly natural for the tech industry.  <em>The New Republic</em> magazine reported earlier this year:</p>

<p class="quote">"Silicon Valley has become one of the most ageist places in America. Tech luminaries who otherwise pride themselves on their dedication to meritocracy don’t think twice about deriding the not-actually-old...it’s better to be perceived as naïve and immature than to have voted in the 1980s."
  <a class="ref" href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism">2</a></p>

  <h2><span class="title-ital">Ageism and competition in Silicon Valley are reportedly leading more and more <em>young</em> techies to pursue cosmetic surgery procedures</span></h2>

  <p>A plastic surgeon named Dr. Matarasso, the self-proclaimed “world’s second biggest dispenser of Botox,” explained to <em>The New Republic</em> that age discrimination in Silicon Valley has actually reached such a point in the last ten to fifteen years that nowadays it’s normal for techies starting in their late 20s and early 30s to come to him asking for botox injections and other cosmetic procedures.  <em>The New Republic</em> quotes Dr. Matarasso as saying: </p>

  <p class="quote">“It’s really morphed into, ‘Hey, I’m forty years old and I have to get in front of a board of fresh-faced kids. I can’t look like I have a wife and two-point-five kids and a mortgage,’ he told me.”<a class="ref" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-ageism-2014-3">3</a></p>

  <h2><span class="title-ital">What fuels age discrimination in tech?</span></h2>

  <p>Reasons given by employers who are guilty of age discrimination mostly tend to pin the blame on a crude mythologization of market realities:
    <ul class="subpoints">
        <li>"People over forty-five basically die in terms of new ideas."
        <li>Older programmers bring "technology baggage"</li>
        <li>It's ultimately more economical to train young, inexperienced techies who agree to work for lower wages and vague promises</li>
    </ul>
<h2><span class="title-ital">The Only Solution: Staying Marketable in the Long Run</span></h2>
    <p>Given that the pressures of age discrimination in the tech industry do not appear to be on the verge of easing up anytime soon, industry commentators tend to offer little comfort for aging programmers.  Advice I found included the following suggestions:
      <ul>
        <li><em>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em</em> (i.e., become a person who hires employees, instead of being a job-seeker)</li>
        <li>Keep your skills current</li>
        <li>Become a consultant or start a business</li>
        <li>Come up with a Plan B<a class="ref" href="http://improvingsoftware.com/2009/05/19/programmers-before-you-turn-40-get-a-plan-b/">4</a></li>
      </ul>
