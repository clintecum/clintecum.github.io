    <h1>Handling Conflict</h1>
<p class="less-indent">When I was a computer tech I encountered many conflicts on the job both with my boss, which oftentimes reached the point that I just wanted to quit my job right there on the spot because of the things he'd start to say about me to my face whenever he got frustrated or angry.  Pretty much every week involved at least one or two incidents where I was made out to be an idiot who wasn't smart enough to handle even the most basic, petty responsibilities.  I don't want to blame everything on just one person's tyrannical personality, when clearly there was a whole dysfunctional dynamic between the two of us, but I think the conflicts did in general stem for the most part from unclear leadership, ambiguous expectations, poor communication, and bad conflict resolution skills.  Really I think my boss just hated my personality, and was threatened by my educational background, I'm not really sure - I just remember how he always made a point of finding fault in my work, even when I was able to troubleshoot computer problems successfully despite next to zero training, absolutely no guidance, and a near total lack of any explicit company procedures to follow.  Conflicts with my boss over my job performance made me feel very bad about myself and eventually caused me to doubt my own ability to succeed in the tech field.</p>

<p class="less-indent">One good example of the kind of conflicts I encountered in that job was the time I was asked to repair my boss's friend's wife's Sony VAIO laptop which of course is made from cheap plastic parts that are very difficult to find.  I can't even remember what the exact problem with the laptop was, just that I had to take it apart piece by piece and clean out several years of orangish food crumbs in the keyboard.  In the end I was not able to put it back together successfully because the motherboard was missing a very crucial little plastic clip that keeps the IO ribbon in place.  Somehow the laptop had miraculously worked just fine for a few years without the ribbon becoming disconnected, but once the keyboard had been removed from the chassis for cleaning there was absolutely no way to get it to seated snugly back in there again.  So in short I ended up taking the blame for the manufacturer's defective product, and my boss bought a new laptop for his friend's wife out of his own pocket, and took it as another opportunity to openly question why he'd ever hired me.  When I finally came across definitive proof about a month later that the unsuccessful repair was not in fact my fault, he didn't bother to clear my reputation, which bothered me given that he'd made such a point of blaming the botched repair on my incompotence as a computer tech....which was irritating because the guy worked about a hundred feet away and was thus a frequent presence in the shop.</p>

<p class="less-indent">That conflict sticks out to me because it was especially frustrating.  I wasted more hours than I bothered to count trying to fix the laptop, for absolutely nothing (if you've never taken apart a laptop --- it's extremely tedious work that's inherently prone to causing hypertension).   At the time, I felt like I'd been unfairly called incompotent and was unhappy about being thrown under the bus in front of the customer.</p>

<p class="less-indent">I never did figure out how to handle conflicts with my boss very well, so I ended up quitting my job about two months later.  If I could go back to that situation, the only thing I would do differently is quit sooner.  I ended up learning that I don't want to work for people who don't appreciate employees who consistently give their best effort despite the lack of any enticing material rewards or at least some form of positive feedback for routine tasks completed successfully on time, on the whole.</p>
