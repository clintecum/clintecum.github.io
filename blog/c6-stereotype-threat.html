  <h1>Stereotype Threats</h1>

<p class="less-indent">As a white male from Kansas who’s spent his whole life in the Midwest I won’t pretend to have suffered substantially from any instances of stereotype threats adversely affecting my ability to perform in the workplace or in some kind of academic setting.  I can certainly try to imagine what it’s like to face this kind of challenge as a member of a minority or disadvantaged group, but I won’t pretend to know directly what it feels like to deal with “the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype” resulting in “subconscious self-handicapping.”  As a person who finds racism and other forms of social inequality unacceptable, and as someone who’s dealt with subconscious self-handicapping in his own right, however, I can have a great deal of sympathy for anyone who’s dealing with this sort of thing during their time at DBC.
</p>
<p class="less-indent">Although we’re all the same as human beings, as individuals we are all different, so I’m not sure I can state abstractly what I plan to do to intervene if I see someone dealing with this while I’m at DBC.  I’d definitely try to be sensitive towards the situation, and maybe offer extra support and encouragement to the person, but I wouldn’t necessarily force them to talk about their own subconscious self-handicapping publicly right then and there.  I doubt that it’s always entirely obvious when it’s happening, because people can be pretty good about hiding things that are bothering them.  I believe I can help make my surrounding environment more welcoming by just being friendly to everyone I meet and generally treating people the same.  I didn’t come to DBC to compete against anybody else so hopefully we’ll all just have the same attitude of wanting to work together and help each other learn while we’re all going through the same process.</p>
