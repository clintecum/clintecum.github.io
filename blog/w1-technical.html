  <h1>Version Control with git and GitHub<h1>
    <h3>December 12, 2014</h1>
      <h2>What are the benefits of version control?</h2>
  <p>
The main benefits to version control include change tracking and simplified accountability between contributors to files or code stored in a tracked repository. Change tracking means that source code can be easily reverted back to previous states as necessary whenever something goes wrong just by running a few commands at the command line. When contributors regularly employ best practices such as writing good commit messages, team members can more easily understand each other's work, and changes made to shared files can be integrated without merge conflicts. In short, version control helps organize, streamline and ultimately safeguard development workflow.</p>
<h2>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h2>
<p>Git helps developers keep track of changes by saving all new changes made to repository files in the form of packaged bundles called commits, which include not only the new file changes themselves, but also message labels, time and date, and other useful pieces of information that help to uniquely identify each new commit. To quickly see an overview history of all changes, then, you simply scroll through the repository log, which includes parameters to help you narrow down what kind of information you're specifically looking for. Git also helps you keep track of unstaged changes as they are happening in the form of branches.</p>
<h2>Why should you use GitHub to store your code?</h2>
<p>Using GitHub as an online Git repository hosting service is a great idea for open source developers because it makes it easy to copy repositories, so developers can write new contributions to source code safely on their own local computers, and then push their new commits back to the original repository on GitHub whenever there's a reason for changes to be reviewed by someone else and merged with the original. GitHub provides an easy way for developers scattered all over the world to collaborate on code, share feedback, and manage projects.</p>
