  <h1><br>Learning from Pair Programming and Feedback at DBC</h1>

      <p class="less-indent">Pairing with others is usually fun and definitely always rewarding in some sense or another.  It’s great when everything just clicks easily with someone else, but it’s also helpful to go through sessions that don’t quite go as smoothly.  To be honest, there’s always at least some minimal level of anticipation prior to pairing with someone else.  You know your understanding is about to be put to the test, and sometimes that can be kind of stressful if you feel like you’re struggling with something.
</p>
      <p class="less-indent">
Working with someone else is a good way to pick up random tips, enforce best practices, and see how others go about solving problems in ways that can be surprisingly different from what you would have come up with on your own.  It’s also interesting to observe how different people at this school are in terms of their workflow and communication style.  Overall I think pairing to work on challenges with other students is a really beneficial process and I’m glad we’re getting used to it early on in our development.  Some sessions are inevitably more positive than others, but I really haven’t had any negative experiences so far.
      </p>
      <p class="less-indent">
Giving feedback isn’t always easy, but it’s something I try to take more and more seriously every time I do it, because it can be so valuable when someone really puts some thought into what they’re saying.  Sometimes it’s hard because you feel like the person you paired with has done a great job and understands things so much better than you, so it’s hard to know what you can say to them that’s helpful to them.  Other times it’s hard just figuring out how to phrase things in such a way that’s both kind and actionable.  I’m finding that rating others’ feedback is very helpful because it inevitably teaches you how to give better feedback in turn.

      </p>
      <p class="less-indent">
It’s not always obvious as it’s happening but I do believe that giving feedback on pairing sessions really helps you to grow as a developer and programmer just because it makes you step back and reflect on someone else’s progress.  If anything it’s helped me become more self-aware of my own thinking style by giving me reference points to evaluate how I naturally tend to go about delving into the challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="less-indent">
I can’t say I’m ever very excited about checking to see what others have to say after pairing with me, although at the very least you know there isn’t going to be anything unkind.  That being said, it’s never been a problem.  Each week I’ve tried to take away at least one thing from feedback I’ve received, mainly depending on how actionable it is.  It’s ranged from needing to smile more and apologize less to very specific technical tips.
