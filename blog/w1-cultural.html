  <h1>Fireside Chat with Shereef<h1>
    <h3>December 10, 2014</h1>
  <p>
I came away from the “Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table” video feeling both more excited about signing up for DBC and also slightly more nervous about the intensive nine weeks. I wouldn’t say Shereef’s fireside chat drastically changed my expectations of DBC, just because I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect from this, but I’m really excited about being around other people who are working toward similar goals right now and who are just as eager as I am to start getting their hands dirty.</p>
