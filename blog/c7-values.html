        VALUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME:<br><br>
        Achievement<br>
        Honesty<br>
        Inspiration<br>
        Close relationships<br>

        <p class="less-indent">
            On a scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree), I'd give myself a 2.5 for how well I've tried to live up to these values since the time when I was happiest in my life (college).
        </p>

        <p class="less-indent">
            I chose inspiration as one of the most important values to me, because I used to be inspired, and was able to draw upon that energy to carry myself a lot further towards my goals in life at that time than I ever would have expected to be possible on my own.  It came from a few people in particular and also just from people in general.
        </p>

        <p class="less-indent">
            I can't say I get asked for tons of advice in life, so it's hard to really remember the last time it happened that stood out to me.  I remember a friend's little brother was going off to college last year, and still hadn't decided where he was going to go by April of his senior year in high school, so I tried to help him talk through his options and maybe give him some things to consider when making that decision.  Of course in my mind the decision most certainly came down to the values which I consider to be most important in my life, but ultimately my advice to him was to figure out what those values are for him, and choose between his options accordingly.  For me, deciding to go to DBC at age 30 was definitely about trying to get closer towards living up to my own core values again.
        </p>

        <p class="less-indent">
            I have mixed feelings when I think about my own core values because I don't feel like I've lived up to them very well.  If I struggle with feeling down at DBC, I'll just have to remind myself why I came, and remember that going through this process is ultimately helping me get closer to living up to my own standards again in life, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="less-indent">
          For me I think it would be useful to regularly check-in with myself about how this process is going in some form, so I can be reminded that I'm making progress, and actually growing.
